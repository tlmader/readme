# About Me

Hi, my name is Ted Mader. I am a software engineer based in San Diego with over six years of experience in full-stack web application development, with a focus on the frontend.

My career in software started at the University of New Orleans, where I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in game development. I learned programming in Java as well as had the oppportunity to make a few video games for my classes:

Note that I will be highlighting any (technologies used).

- [A 2D top-down "action RPG"](https://github.com/tlmader/theodoric) (Phaser)
- [A beat 'em up game where you play as a revenant Abraham Lincoln who was killed and left for dead in the south by Robert E. Lee](https://github.com/uno-game-dev/honest-abe) (Unity)
- [A competitive match 3 game](https://github.com/tlmader/glyphic-heroes) (Unity)
- [An endless runner](https://github.com/tlmader/endless-runner) (Unreal Engine)

I also participated in a research project and completed an undergraduate thesis on [integrating virtual reality with use-of-force training simulations](https://scholarworks.uno.edu/honors_theses/87/) (Unity, HTC Vive).

In the second half of my sophomore year, I received the opportunity to join [GE's Software Engineering Apprenticeship Program](https://www.uno.edu/academics/cos/computer-science/internships#:~:text=GE%20Software%20Engineering%20Apprenticeship%20Program,technical%20mentors%20in%20the%20industry.), or SWEAP for short. Here, I had my first exposure to developing fullstack applications for the web. I contributed code to production applications such as the [GE Oil & Gas engageDrilling platform](https://www.engagedrilling.com/splashpage). I enjoyed learning how to build REST APIs and the different ways to test them (Spring Boot, JUnit, Mockito, Postman). I especially enjoyed creating user interfaces for the browser with JavaScript (AngularJS, Karma, Jasmine, Protractor, Selenium).

After I graduated and transitioned into a fulltime role at GE Digital to work on the [GE Power Field Vision mobile application](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2017/7/how-ge-digital-drives-revenue-strategy-snapshot) (AngularJS, Spring Boot, Couchbase), I shifted to a more frontend-focused role since this was the area I felt that I could bring the most impact (and I really enjoyed the creative aspect of building UIs). At this time, the JavaScript ecosystem was evolving very quickly, and I found that there was a lot to learn. To help catch myself up with the state of JavaScript, I started a side project with a friend to create a [check-in app for the local animal shelter](https://github.com/cerberus-org/cerberus-app) (Angular 2+, NgRx, Firebase). Although the application did not end up being used due to a change in leadership at the shelter, I learned a lot of concepts such as immutability, function purity, state management using a store, how to integrate with backend-as-a-service platforms, and how to set up CI/CD pipelines. This project made me an overall better engineer, and I proliferated a lot of the learnings to my work projects.

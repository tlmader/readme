# About Me

Hi, my name is Ted Mader. I am a software engineer based in San Diego with over six years of experience in full-stack web application development, with a focus on the frontend.

## Computer Science @ UNO
My career in software started at the University of New Orleans, where I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in game development. I learned programming in Java as well as had the oppportunity to make a few video games for my classes:

Note that I will be highlighting any (technologies used).

- [A 2D top-down "action RPG"](https://github.com/tlmader/theodoric) (Phaser)
- [A beat 'em up game where you play as a revenant Abraham Lincoln who was killed and left for dead in the south by Robert E. Lee](https://github.com/uno-game-dev/honest-abe) (Unity)
- [A competitive match 3 game](https://github.com/tlmader/glyphic-heroes) (Unity)
- [An endless runner](https://github.com/tlmader/endless-runner) (Unreal Engine)

I also participated in a research project and completed an undergraduate thesis on [integrating virtual reality with use-of-force training simulations](https://scholarworks.uno.edu/honors_theses/87/) (Unity, HTC Vive).

In the second half of my sophomore year, I received the opportunity to join [GE's Software Engineering Apprenticeship Program](https://www.uno.edu/academics/cos/computer-science/internships#:~:text=GE%20Software%20Engineering%20Apprenticeship%20Program,technical%20mentors%20in%20the%20industry.), or SWEAP for short. Here, I had my first exposure to developing fullstack applications for the web. I contributed code to production applications such as the [GE Oil & Gas engageDrilling platform](https://www.engagedrilling.com/splashpage). I enjoyed learning how to build REST APIs and the different ways to test them (Spring Boot, JUnit, Mockito, Postman). I especially enjoyed creating user interfaces for the browser with JavaScript (AngularJS, Karma/Jasmine, Protractor/Selenium).

## Software Engineer @ GE
After I graduated and transitioned into a full-time role at GE Digital to work on the [GE Power Field Vision mobile application](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2017/7/how-ge-digital-drives-revenue-strategy-snapshot) (AngularJS, Spring Boot, Couchbase), I shifted to a more frontend-focused role since this was the area I felt that I could bring the most impact (and I really enjoyed the creative aspect of building UIs). At this time, the JavaScript ecosystem was evolving very quickly, and I found that there was a lot to learn. To help catch myself up with the state of JavaScript, I started a side project with a friend to create a [check-in app for the local animal shelter](https://github.com/cerberus-org/cerberus-app) (Angular 2+). Although the application did not end up being used due to a change in leadership at the shelter, I learned a lot of concepts such as immutability, function purity, state management using a store (NgRx), how to integrate with backend-as-a-service platforms (Firebase), and how to set up CI/CD pipelines (Travis CI). This project made me an overall better engineer, and I proliferated a lot of the learnings to my work projects.

My next project at GE was Baker Hughes' [Plant Operations Advisor](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/bp-deploys-plant-operations-advisor-on-gulf-of-mexico-platforms.html), where I worked on modernizing their web application (AngularJS, Polymer â†’ Angular 2+, Apollo, GraphQL). I empowered UI development and improved UX consistency by building reusable component libraries utilizing the [Predix Design System](https://www.predix-ui.com/) (Angular 2+, Storybook).

## Software Engineer @ ScienceLogic
I took the next step in my career by transitioning into remote work at [ScienceLogic](https://sciencelogic.com/) to help build the [user interface for their newest product, SL1](https://sciencelogic.com/blog/a-new-defining-moment-for-sciencelogic) (React, Apollo, GraphQL). I built network topology mapping tools with their in-house network visualization engine, [Revis-Network](https://github.com/ScienceLogic/revis-network). Then, I joined their UI infrastructure team to support developers by building reusable component libraries (Material UI, Storybook), discussing and documenting coding patterns and testing strategies (Testing Library, Apollo mocking), and introducing tooling to accelerate development (TypeScript, GraphQL Code Generator).

Outside of work, I created a [map-based mobile app for finding local music](https://www.indienav.com/). I learned how to build and release mobile applications to the Apple and Google app stores (React Native, Expo, Fastlane, GitHub Actions), create cloud-native backend services (Serverless Framework, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, AWS AppSync, Amazon Cognito), and integrate with payments and analytics APIs (Stripe Payments/Connect, Google Analytics, Facebook Analytics). The application is still a work in progress as we adapt it to the post-COVID-19 world.

## Frontend Engineer @ Symmetry Systems
My current chapter takes place at the data security startup, [Symmetry Systems](https://www.symmetry-systems.com/), where I joined to start their React and GraphQL projects. I am very excited to take everything I have learned to help build the next generation of solutions to protect our data and privacy from cyberattacks.
